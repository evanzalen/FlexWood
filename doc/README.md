# doc directory
This directory contains the metadata, _e.g._ some sample information, associated with The FlexWood project.

In the Samples.csv the column "BioID" is the Flexure conditions of the trees, where T89_ROT = Rotating and T89_STA = Stationary.
The TW column stands for Tension Wood, which was determined by eye based on microscopy images.
